This project is based on the starter code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

The [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Installing and starting the server

## Information about the app

The home screen has two tabs:

* "Deck List" displays the currently available decks

* "New Deck" allows you to create a new deck giving it a custom name.

From the Deck List tab, you can click on any deck in order to open the "Deck details". 
"Deck details" screen has the option to quiz yourself on the cards already in the deck. 
Or you can add a new custom card to the deck, providing a question and an answer.
